Overview 
The Fish Disease Detection Application is a revolutionary tool that harnesses the power of deep 
learning to diagnose fish diseases from uploaded images accurately. This documentation provides a 
comprehensive insight into the application's architecture, development journey, and functionalities, 
detailing its current implementation and future scope. The application is designed to address the 
escalating challenge of fish diseases, an issue magnified by factors such as water pollution, climate 
change, overcrowding in aquaculture, and poor water quality management. These environmental 
and anthropogenic factors contribute to the proliferation of bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic 
diseases in aquatic life, threatening biodiversity and sustainable aquaculture. By delivering a precise 
and efficient diagnostic solution, this application seeks to empower fish farmers and contribute to 
the sustainable management of aquaculture systems. 

This project demonstrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify freshwater fish diseases based on image data. It includes dataset preparation, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

Features
Load and preprocess fish disease dataset (train, validation, and test data).
Train a CNN for multi-class classification of fish diseases.
Evaluate the model and visualize results (accuracy, loss, confusion matrix).
Save the trained model for future use.
Setup Instructions

2. Dataset
The project uses a dataset structured as:

markdown
Copy code
Freshwater Fish Disease Aquaculture in south asia/
    Train/
        Class1/
        Class2/
        ...
    Test/
        Class1/

        ...
Replace Class1, Class2, etc., with subdirectories for fish disease categories and healthy fish.

Update train_dir and test_dir in the script with the respective dataset paths.

3. Key Parameters
Image Dimensions: 150x150 pixels.
Batch Size: 32.
Train-Validation Split: 80% training, 20% validation.
4. Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of:

Three convolutional layers (32, 64, 128 filters) with ReLU activation and max-pooling.
Flattening and a dense layer with 128 neurons.
Final dense layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification.
5. Steps in the Code
Data Loading and Preprocessing:
