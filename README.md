AI-Driven Image Processing for Early Detection of Fish Diseases
This project leverages deep learning to provide an innovative solution for diagnosing fish diseases, addressing critical challenges in aquaculture. Our application is designed to empower fish farmers with precise, efficient, and accessible diagnostic tools, helping to reduce fish loss and promote sustainable aquaculture practices.

Overview
Aquaculture faces growing threats from diseases caused by water pollution, overcrowding, and poor management. Our solution harnesses the power of AI to identify bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic diseases through image processing. The application is built on a robust custom CNN model tailored for this purpose and is supported by an intuitive web application for user accessibility.

Key Features

Custom CNN Model: Achieved 91.68% test accuracy, balancing performance and computational efficiency.
Web Application: Allows users to upload images for real-time disease diagnosis.
ChatGPT Integration: Provides detailed, disease-specific insights, including treatment recommendations and preventive measures.
Real-Time Monitoring: Designed for future expansion to analyze video feeds for continuous health monitoring.
Mobile Accessibility: Plans for a user-friendly mobile app to ensure broad adoption among fishermen.

Results

VGG19: 98% accuracy but prone to overfitting, unsuitable for deployment.
MobileNetV2: 79% accuracy, computationally efficient but limited in complex classifications.
EfficientNet: 66% accuracy, insufficient for practical use.
Custom CNN: Delivered optimal performance with fast inference and scalability.

Future Enhancements
