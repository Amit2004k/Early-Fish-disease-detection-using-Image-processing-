Overview 
The Fish Disease Detection Application is a revolutionary tool that harnesses the power of deep 
learning to diagnose fish diseases from uploaded images accurately. This documentation provides a 
comprehensive insight into the application's architecture, development journey, and functionalities, 
detailing its current implementation and future scope. The application is designed to address the 
escalating challenge of fish diseases, an issue magnified by factors such as water pollution, climate 
change, overcrowding in aquaculture, and poor water quality management. These environmental 
and anthropogenic factors contribute to the proliferation of bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic 
diseases in aquatic life, threatening biodiversity and sustainable aquaculture. By delivering a precise 
and efficient diagnostic solution, this application seeks to empower fish farmers and contribute to 
the sustainable management of aquaculture systems.
